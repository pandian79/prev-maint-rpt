      "Review the database alert/error log around the time of the latest run to identify the exact error codes and messages.",
      "Group recent errors by error code to see if a single recurring issue (e.g., space, locks, connectivity) is dominating.",
      "Check recent configuration or deployment changes (schema changes, parameter updates, version upgrades) that coincide with the time new errors started.",
      "Verify database resource health (disk space, I/O latency, CPU, memory, connection pool utilization) to rule out infrastructure issues.",
      "Create alerts or thresholds on this metric so that sudden spikes in new errors trigger immediate investigation."
