    "Interpretation": "An agent that is not running will not be able to collect metrics from the components assigned to it for monitoring. Without metrics, the eG manager will have no basis for determining the state of the related components, and will hence be forced to attach an Unknown state to all components monitored by that agent. Use the detailed diagnosis of this measure to identify the agents that are not currently running."

    "Measurement": "Not installed licensed agents",
    "Description": "Indicates the number of agents (configured in the eG manager) that have not been installed.",
    "MeasurementUnit": "Number",
    "Interpretation": "While actively using the eG Enterprise Suite, you may come across situations where an agent is configured in the eG manager for monitoring one/more components, but the agent software is not physically deployed on a host. The value of this measure is indicative of how many such configured but not installed agents are available in the environment. Such agents again will not be able to extract performance statistics from components. These components will hence assume the Unknown state, until the agent is physically deployed and started. Use the detailed diagnosis of this measure to know which agents are yet to be installed."
