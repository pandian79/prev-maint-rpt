    "measurement": "Number of configuration errors",
    "description": "Indicates the total number of configuration errors detected by the eG Configuration Checks test.",
    "unit": "Number",
    "interpretation": "This measure reflects how many configuration settings are currently invalid, inconsistent, or missing according to the checks defined for the monitored environment. A value greater than zero means that one or more configuration issues have been found; higher values indicate broader misconfiguration and an increased risk of failures, security exposures, or degraded performance.",
    "troubleshootingSteps": [
      "Use the test’s detailed diagnosis to list each configuration error, including the component, parameter name, current value, and the rule or expectation that it violates.[web:259][web:260][web:261]",
      "Prioritize remediation of errors affecting availability, security, and data integrity (for example, missing mandatory parameters, invalid paths, unreachable endpoints, or incorrect credentials).",
      "Validate and correct configuration values directly in the relevant product consoles or configuration files, then re-run the Configuration Checks test to confirm that the errors have been resolved.[web:261][web:262]",
      "For recurring configuration errors, update templates, automation scripts, or baseline configurations so that new components are deployed with correct settings from the outset.[web:259][web:261]",
      "Incorporate configuration checks into regular operational procedures and change management so that new changes are verified promptly and latent configuration issues are detected early.[web:256][web:258]"
