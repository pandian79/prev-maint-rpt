    "measurement": "Machine stability index",
    "description": "Indicates the percentage of machines that were stable.",
    "measurementUnit": "Percent",
    "interpretation": "A higher value (close to 100%) means the machine is highly stable, with few or no significant issues. A low value may indicate frequent application crashes, OS hangs, driver failures, unexpected reboots, and system errors in Event Viewer; such machines require immediate attention to maintain or restore stability. Detailed diagnosis shows date/time, event ID, type, source, application, path, and message for events impacting stability.",

      "Open Reliability Monitor (reliability history) and look for recent drops in the stability index, focusing on days with many critical events or application failures.[web:559][web:562][web:565][web:568]",
      "Use Event Viewer (System and Application logs) around the timestamps of crashes or hangs to identify recurring error IDs (e.g., driver faults, disk warnings, kernel-power events).?[web:560][web:564][web:567][web:570]",
      "Update or roll back problematic device drivers (GPU, storage, chipset, network) and ensure BIOS/firmware and Windows updates are current.[web:557][web:558][web:560][web:563]",
      "Run system integrity checks such as `sfc /scannow` and `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` to repair corrupted system files.[web:557][web:559][web:565]",
      "Check hardware health: run memory diagnostics, check disk SMART status, monitor temperatures, and verify PSU stability if freezes or spontaneous reboots occur.[web:559][web:560][web:561]",
      "Reduce startup and background applications that may conflict or overload the system, and test in Safe Mode or Clean Boot to isolate problematic software.[web:559][web:567][web:570]"
