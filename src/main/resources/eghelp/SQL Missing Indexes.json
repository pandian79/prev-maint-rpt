Detailed diagnosis can show the specific tables and columns for which indexes are missing, helping DBAs decide whether to create new indexes or instead tune queries to better use existing ones.[web:181][web:182][web:185]",

      "Review the detailed diagnosis or DMVs (such as sys.dm_db_missing_index_details and related views) to list missing index recommendations, including affected tables and key/included columns.[web:181][web:182][web:185]",
      "Before creating any suggested index, compare recommendations against existing indexes on the same table to avoid redundant or overlapping indexes and to keep index count manageable.[web:181][web:183][web:187]",
      "Prioritize missing index suggestions by estimated performance benefit or usage stats (for example, using group_stats DMVs or custom reports) so you implement the most impactful indexes first.[web:181][web:186][web:189]",
      "For high-impact suggestions, craft and test tailored CREATE INDEX statements, possibly combining equality, inequality, and included columns into well-designed nonclustered indexes rather than blindly using auto-generated scripts.[web:181][web:182][web:183]",
      "After adding or adjusting indexes, monitor query performance and missing-index DMVs again (or Query Store if enabled) to confirm that the recommendations decline and that query runtimes and I/O costs improve.[web:181][web:186][web:190]"
