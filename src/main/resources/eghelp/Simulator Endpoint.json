    "interpretation": "This measure shows if there is an active user session on the logon simulation endpoint. The value \"Yes\" (numeric 1) means a session is currently active, while \"No\" (numeric 0) means there is no active session. Dashboards typically plot the numeric values 0 and 1 to visualize when the session status changes over time.",
    "troubleshootingSteps": [
      "If the value remains \"No\" when a session is expected to be active, verify that the logon simulation is configured and scheduled correctly.",
      "Check the health and connectivity of the simulation endpoint and any synthetic/agent process responsible for maintaining the session.",
      "Confirm that authentication steps (credentials, MFA, redirects) are succeeding so that a session can be established and kept alive.",
      "Correlate session status changes with application outages, login errors, or maintenance windows to understand why sessions may be dropping."
