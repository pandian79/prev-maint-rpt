Problems with a network adapter or other network device (either physical problems or configuration problems) can interfere with connectivity. Therefore, ideally, the value of this measure should be 0.",
    "troubleshootingSteps": [
      "Check physical connectivity: Ensure cables are connected, switch ports are active, and the network adapter is not disabled or failed in the OS.",
      "Verify network configuration: Check IP settings, subnet masks, and VLAN tagging to ensure the interface can communicate with other cluster nodes.",
      "Review cluster network settings: Use Failover Cluster Manager or PowerShell (Get-ClusterNetworkInterface) to verify the interface is correctly assigned to the cluster network and not in a 'Failed' state.",
      "Inspect hardware and drivers: Update network adapter drivers and firmware; check for hardware faults or replace faulty NICs if necessary.",
      "Check firewall and security software: Ensure Windows Firewall or third-party security software is not blocking cluster communication ports (UDP 3343, TCP 3343, etc.)."
