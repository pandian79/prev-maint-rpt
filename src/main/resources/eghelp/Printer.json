    "measurement": "Is the printer service available",
    "description": "Shows whether the printer is available for printing or not.",
    "unit": "Boolean",
    "interpretation": "A value of 0 indicates that the printer is not available for printing, and a value of 1 indicates that it is available. A printer may be unavailable if it is off the network due to a power shutdown or network connection failure, or if it is on the network but does not support SNMP or is in an unknown state.",
    "troubleshootingSteps": [
      "If the value is 0, first verify basic connectivity: check printer power, cabling, and that the device is connected to the correct network segment.",
      "Confirm that network routing and firewall rules allow communication between the monitoring system and the printer.",
      "Check whether SNMP is enabled and correctly configured on the printer if SNMP is required for status detection.",
      "Inspect the printer’s front panel or embedded web UI for error or unknown states (e.g., jams, door open, no paper/toner) and resolve any reported issues."
