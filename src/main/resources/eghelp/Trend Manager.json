Users to the eG monitoring and reporting consoles can query the data in the trend tables to generate trend graphs and reports. These graphs/reports enable administrators to clearly understand the historical trends in performance, on the basis of which they can accurately predict future performance and effectively plan the future capacity of the environment. Using this test, you can understand how efficient the trend manager process is.This shows whether the trend manager is actively running, idle, in error, not yet started, or was interrupted. A healthy environment should typically report Running or sometimes Sleeping; Error, Not Started, or Interrupted indicate conditions that can block trend computations. Charts use the numeric codes 0–4 while the UI shows the textual states."
