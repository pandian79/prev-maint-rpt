      "Check for firewall rules blocking UDP/TCP port 3343 or ICMP (Ping), which are required for heartbeat and status updates.[web:312][web:455]",
      "If the issue persists after correcting network settings, try disabling and re-enabling the network adapter or restarting the Cluster Service on the affected node to force a topology refresh.[web:453][web:457][web:460]"
