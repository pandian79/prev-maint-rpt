    "description": "Indicates the number of errors that were added to the error log file when the test was last executed.",
    "measurementUnit": "Number",
    "interpretation": "The value of this measure is a clear indicator of the number of ‘new’ alerts that were logged into the error log of the monitored eG agent.",
    "troubleshootingSteps": [
      "Examine the agent error log file and note the exact error messages and timestamps to identify recent failures or patterns.",
      "Confirm the agent is running and communicating with the central server; check agent heartbeat/last-seen timestamp and network connectivity (firewall, ports).",
      "Verify disk space and file permissions on the agent host to ensure the agent can write/read its log files and rotate logs properly.",
      "Search for correlated events in system logs (OS event log, application logs) around the same timestamps to identify root causes.",
      "If errors reference a specific plugin/module, validate that the plugin configuration and dependencies are correct and up to date.",
      "Increase agent log verbosity (temporarily) and reproduce the issue to capture more detailed context, then revert verbosity when finished.",
      "Check for recent configuration changes or software updates on the monitored host that could have introduced the errors; roll back if necessary.",
      "Restart the agent service gracefully to see if errors clear; document whether errors reappear after restart to distinguish transient versus persistent issues.",
      "Collect and attach the agent logs, configuration files, and environment details (OS, agent version) when escalating to support or the vendor.",
      "If the agent is unable to send logs to the central server, test connectivity (telnet or equivalent to agent server port) and review certificate/SSL issues if secure channels are used."
